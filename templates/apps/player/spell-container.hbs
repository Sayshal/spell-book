/**
 * Player Spell Book Main Container Template
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Primary container template for the player spell book interface providing the
 * structural foundation for spell display and management. Serves as the main
 * content area where spell tabs and spell listings are dynamically rendered,
 * with additional container for collapsed sidebar footer functionality.
 *
 * CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS:
 * This template uses minimal context as it primarily serves as a structural
 * foundation. Content is dynamically populated by the application's rendering
 * system rather than passed through template context.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES:
 * - Main content section with role="main" for landmark navigation
 * - Descriptive aria-label for spell list content identification
 * - Complementary footer container with role="complementary"
 * - Semantic section element for proper document structure
 * - Hidden footer container uses proper accessibility attributes
 *
 * CUSTOMIZATION POINTS:
 * - Main content area serves as dynamic rendering target for spell tabs
 * - Collapsed footer container toggles visibility based on sidebar state
 * - Container structure adapts to different application rendering modes
 * - Footer search container provides alternate location for search controls
 *
 * INTEGRATION:
 * - Connects to PlayerSpellBook application as primary content container
 * - Serves as rendering target for dynamic spell tab content
 * - Integrates with sidebar collapse/expand functionality
 * - Provides structure for responsive layout management
 * - Works with application part-based rendering system
