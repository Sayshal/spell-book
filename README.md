# Updated Implementation Strategy

## Completed Work

The Spell Book module has been developed with a robust foundation:

- Extended compendium browser UI with a custom `PlayerSpellBook` application
- Filter management system with configurable filters and sort options
- Spell preparation tracking with visual indicators
- Integration with long rest hooks
- Character sheet button integration
- Responsive UI with collapsible sidebar
- Spell level organization and collapsible sections

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

### 1. GM Spell List Manager

- Create a dedicated UI for GMs to manage custom spell lists
- Enable creating, editing, and saving of custom spell lists to journal entries
- Add ability to assign custom spell lists to classes or specific characters

**Proposed file structure for GM tools:**

- scripts/apps/gm-spell-list-manager.mjs - GM-facing UI for creating/editing spell lists

### 2. Level-Up Detection and Prompting

- Implement a system to detect when a character gains a level
- Create a notification system to prompt for spell selection on level-up
- Design a specialized interface for selecting new spells during level advancement
- Handle different spellcasting class progressions (prepared casters vs. known spell casters)

**Proposed hook integration:**

- Add a handler for "dnd5e.advancement.complete" hook
- Check if the advancement is for a class with spellcasting
- Trigger spell selection prompt when appropriate

### 3. Spell Import/Export System

- Enable sharing of spell configurations between players
- Implement spell loadout presets for different scenarios (combat, utility, etc.)

## Technical Refinements

### Performance Optimization

- Implement batched loading for spell documents to reduce initial load time
- Add caching for compendium lookups to improve performance
- Optimize DOM manipulation during filter operations

### UI/UX Improvements

- Create a "favorites" system for commonly used spells
- Add spell component tracking and management (material components)
