## Introduction

**Spell Book** transforms spell management in FoundryVTT with two powerful tools: the **Spell Book** interface for players and the **Spell List Manager** for GMs. Navigate your magical arsenal through an intuitive interface that fully supports both 2014 and 2024 D&D rules. From preparation to casting, handle everything in one centralized location with full multiclass support and class-specific rule customization.

The module streamlines spell management so you can focus on what mattersâ€”playing your game and unleashing arcane power in your adventures.

## Why Spell Book?
