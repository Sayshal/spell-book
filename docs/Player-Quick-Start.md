# Player Quick Start

This guide helps players get started with the Spell Book module quickly and efficiently.

## Before You Begin

### Clean Up Your Spell List

For the best experience, **delete all spells from your character sheet that aren't granted by your class, subclass, or items** before opening Spell Book for the first time.

The module will automatically detect and organize spells that belong to your character, but starting with a clean slate prevents any confusion about which spells should be available.

## Opening Your Spell Book

You can open your Spell Book through:

- The **Spell Book button** on your character sheet
- A **macro** from your hotbar
- Token controls (if configured by your GM)

## Basic Spell Preparation

### Understanding the Interface

When you open your Spell Book, you'll see:

- **Class tabs** on the right side showing each of your spellcasting classes
- **Spell levels** organized from cantrips through 9th level
- **Checkboxes** next to each spell for preparation
- **Footer information** showing your preparation limits and current count

### Preparing Spells

1. **Select your class tab** - Each class prepares spells independently
2. **Check the boxes** next to spells you want to prepare
3. **Monitor the footer** - It shows your current prepared count vs. your limit
4. **Cantrips are separate** - They have their own selection rules and limits

### Understanding Spell Tags

Spells display various tags to indicate their status:

- **Prepared** - Currently prepared and ready to cast
- **Granted** - Automatically prepared by class feature or item
- **At Will** - Can be cast without using spell slots
- **Pact** - Uses pact magic slots (Warlock)
- **Ritual** - Can be cast as a ritual
- **Innate** - Innate spellcasting ability

### Checkbox States

- ‚òê **Empty checkbox** - Spell not prepared, click to prepare
- ‚òë **Checked checkbox** - Spell prepared, click to unprepare
- üîí **Locked checkbox** - Spell always prepared (granted by class/item)

## Reading the Footer

The footer provides crucial information about your spell preparation:

![spellbook-footer.png](https://github.com/Sayshal/spell-book/blob/main/github_media/spellbook-footer.png)

- **Preparation Count**: Shows "X / Y Prepared" for each class
- **Cantrip Count**: Displays separately from leveled spells
- **Class-Specific Limits**: Each class shows its own preparation limit
- **Real-Time Updates**: Numbers update as you check/uncheck spells

## Multiclass Characters

If you have multiple spellcasting classes, Spell Book makes management simple:

![spellbook-multiclass-tabs.png](https://github.com/Sayshal/spell-book/blob/main/github_media/spellbook-multiclass-tabs.png)

- **Separate tabs** for each spellcasting class (shown with class icons)
- **Independent preparation** - Each class maintains its own prepared spells
- **Shared spell slots** - The system automatically calculates multiclass slots
- **Clear organization** - Never mix up which spells belong to which class

### Tab Navigation

- Click the **class icon** on the right to switch between classes
- Each tab maintains its own filter and preparation state
- The active tab is highlighted for clarity

## Wizard Spellbook Management

Wizards have a special **Spellbook tab** for managing their learned spells:

The wizard spellbook tab features a special icon: ![icon.png](https://github.com/Sayshal/spell-book/blob/main/github_media/icon.png)

### Learning New Spells

1. **Navigate to your Spellbook tab** (look for the tinted book icon)
2. **Find spells to learn** - They'll have a "Learn Spell" button
3. **Check the footer** - It shows how many spells you know and if you have free spells remaining
4. **Learn the spell** - Click the button and confirm the cost (if any)
5. **Already Learned** - Once learned, spells show this tag instead of the button

### Free Spells vs. Purchased Spells

- **Free Spells**: Gained when you level up (configurable by your GM)
- **Purchased Spells**: Copied from scrolls or other sources for gold
- The footer tracks how many free spells you have remaining

## Filter and Search
