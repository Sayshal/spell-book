# Ruleset Types and What They Mean

## Rule Enforcement Modes
The Spell Book supports three enforcement modes, each providing a different balance between player freedom and rules compliance.

### Unenforced Mode
In Unenforced Mode, the system does not restrict player actions. Characters can prepare any spell, bypass limits, or use features outside normal rules.

Players have full control over spell preparation, swapping, and casting.
Useful for narrative-driven campaigns, experimental gameplay, or early testing of homebrew rules.

When to Use Unenforced Rules:
- Sandbox campaigns where player creativity is prioritized over strict mechanics.
- Early session setup or module testing before enabling enforcement.

> Note: While Unenforced Mode is flexible, it does not notify the GM of potential rule violations.

### Notify GM Mode (Suggested Mode)
Notify GM Mode provides a middle ground between full freedom and strict enforcement. The system will allow player actions but alerts the GM to potential rule violations.

GM Alerts and Warnings:
- Visual or textual notifications appear when a player prepares spells outside allowed limits, and changes prepared spells.
- Notifications include details about the violation.

Balancing Player Freedom with Oversight:
- Players retain flexibility to experiment.
- GMs maintain awareness of potential inconsistencies.

This mode is ideal for campaigns that favor flexibility but still require accountability.

### Enforced Mode
Strict Rule Enforcement:
The system prevents any action that violates configured rules.
Players cannot prepare more spells than allowed, or prepare spells outside of predetermined times (after long rests or on level up).

Automatic Prevention of Rule Violations, exceeding preparation limits is blocked.


Recommended Scenarios for Enforced Mode:
- Competitive or rules-heavy campaigns.
- Sessions with new players needing guidance on correct spellcasting behavior.
- Campaigns with complex homebrew restrictions.

## Rule Categories

The Spell Book can enforce rules in the following categories:

- Spell Preparation Rules:
    Ensures characters prepare only the spells allowed by their class, subclass, or modifiers.
- Multiclass Spellcasting Rules:
    Validates cross-class preparation, and shared resources.
- Class-Specific Restrictions: Enforces limitations on spells granted by class or subclass spell lists.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Choosing Appropriate Enforcement Levels
Choosing Appropriate Enforcement Levels
- Unenforced Mode: For sandbox play or testing new features.
- Notify GM Mode: For flexibility with oversight; good for campaigns with new or experimental rules. This is the recommended enforcement level
- Enforced Mode: For strict adherence to D&D 5e rules or campaigns with complex mechanics.

### Configuring Rule Exceptions
- Specific spells, subclasses, or homebrew features can be exempted from enforcement if needed.
- Exceptions are managed per character via the Spell Book Settings dialog in their specific Spell Book.
