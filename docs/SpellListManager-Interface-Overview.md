# SpellListManager Interface Overview

## Accessing Spell List Manager

Only a GM (Or GM Assistant) User can access the **Spell List Manager**.
To open it, navigate to the Compendium tab in the right-hand sidebar. At the bottom of the Compendium interface, click the **Spell List Manager** button.

## Interface Components

The Spell List Manager is divided into three primary areas:

- Left Sidebar – Spell list navigation
- Center Panel – Spell list data and editing
- Right Panel – Spell selection and filtering tools

### Spell List Navigation (Left Sidebar)

At the top-left of the window, next to the Available Spell Lists title, are two action buttons:
- Merge – Combine two existing spell lists into a new custom spell list
- Create – Create a new custom spell list from scratch

Below these buttons is the spell list navigation sidebar, organized into three sections:

#### Player Spell Book
Lists tied directly to wizard characters, or characters with Force Wizard Mode enabled. These lists represent the spells that character has learned and currently has access to.

#### Custom Spell Lists
Spell lists you have created manually or generated by merging other spell lists. These are fully editable and are typically used to define class, subclass, or homebrew spell availability.

#### Spell Lists
Default spell lists provided by the game system (such as D&D 5e) and any enabled modules that add spell lists.

To select a spell list, left-click on it. The selected spell list will load into the center panel, where its contents can be viewed or edited.


### Spell Management Panel (Center Panel)

The center panel displays the contents of the currently selected spell list.

To begin editing a spell list, click the Edit button at the top-center of the window. While in edit mode, you can add, remove, or reorganize spells within the list.

This panel reflects all changes made through the tools in the right-hand panel in real time.

### Spell Selection & Tools (Right Panel)

The right-hand panel contains the tools used to browse, filter, and add spells to the selected spell list.

Here you can:
- Search and filter spells from your configured spell compendiums
- Add spells individually by clicking the plus (+) icon next to a spell

Selection Mode

At the bottom-right corner of the window is the Selection Mode toggle.

When enabled:
- The plus (+) icons are replaced with checkboxes
- You can select multiple spells at once
- Selected spells can be added to the spell list in a single action

This is especially useful when building or updating large spell lists.

### Dialog Integration
The Spell List Manager includes several integrated dialogs to help manage and compare spell data.

#### Spell Comparison Dialog

Each spell entry includes a small blue clipboard icon with a question mark. This is the Spell Comparison button.

Selecting this button on two or more spells opens the Spell Comparison dialog. This window displays key spell information side by side, such as:

- Damage type
- Casting level
- Spell school

This tool is useful when balancing spell lists or comparing similar spells during list creation.


#### Spell Details Customization Dialog

In the bottom-right corner of the Spell List Manager window, click Configure Display to open the customization dialog.

This menu allows you to:

- Customize which spell details are shown
- Hide specific fields to reduce visual clutter
- Adjust display options for both the Spell Book and Spell List Manager
- These settings help tailor the interface to your preferred level of detail.

## Common Workflows
The following workflows outline the most common GM tasks performed within the Spell List Manager and how to complete them efficiently.

### Creating custom spell lists
Custom spell lists are typically used to define spell availability for classes, subclasses, homebrew content, or setting-specific restrictions.

1. Open the Spell List Manager from the Compendium tab.
2. In the Spell List Navigation sidebar, click Create next to Available Spell Lists.
3. Provide a name for the new spell list.
4. Select the newly created spell list from the left sidebar.
5. Click Edit in the center panel to enable editing.
6. Use the right-hand panel to browse and filter spells from your configured compendiums.
7. Add spells to the list:
    - Click the plus (+) icon to add spells individually, or
    - Enable Selection Mode to add multiple spells at once.
8. Review the list contents in the center panel and make any final adjustments.
9. Exit edit mode when finished.

Once created, custom spell lists appear under Custom Spell Lists and can be assigned to player characters through their spell book settings.

### Modifying existing spell lists
Existing spell lists—both custom lists and system-provided lists—can be reviewed and, where permitted, modified.

1. Open the Spell List Manager.
2. Select a spell list from the left sidebar.
3. Review the list contents in the center panel.
4. Click Edit to enable modifications.
5. Make changes as needed:
    - Add spells using the right-hand panel
    - Remove spells directly from the list
6. Use the Spell Comparison dialog to compare similar spells when deciding what to keep or remove.
7. Exit edit mode to save changes.

Note: System-provided spell lists are restricted. In these cases, Spell Book makes a duplicate of the list for you to edit, hiding the original system provided list so your changes arent lost.

### Managing player access to spell lists
Spell lists determine which spells are available to player characters and how their spell books behave.

1. Ensure GM Setup Mode is enabled while making mass changes.
2. Use the Spell List Manager to create or adjust the spell lists needed for your campaign.
3. Open a player character’s sheet.
4. Access the character’s Spell Book settings.
5. Assign one or more spell lists to the character.
6. Review the character’s spell book to confirm the correct spells are available.
7. Disable GM Setup Mode once configuration is complete.

Player characters will only be able to learn, prepare, or interact with spells that exist on their assigned spell lists.
