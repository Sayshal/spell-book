/**
 * Managers Module Exports
 *
 * Central export point for all business logic managers in the Spell Book module.
 * This module provides access to the complete suite of manager classes that handle
 * specific aspects of spell management, data processing, and user interaction.
 *
 * The managers are organized by functional responsibility:
 * - Spell preparation and validation management
 * - Cantrip-specific mechanics and swap handling
 * - Party coordination and multi-character spell analysis
 * - Rule set application and class-specific configuration
 * - Loadout management for quick spell preparation switching
 * - Usage tracking and analytics data collection
 * - User data storage and journal-based persistence
 * - Wizard spellbook mechanics and spell copying
 * - Macro management and compendium operations
 *
 * Each manager is designed to be instantiated as needed and provides a focused
 * API for its specific domain of functionality. Many managers integrate with
 * each other to provide spell management capabilities.
