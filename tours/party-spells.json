    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Title": "Party Spell\nCoordination",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Description": "Learn how to coordinate spell preparation across your entire party for optimal coverage.\n\nRequires: Character must be in a party",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Welcome.Title": "Welcome to Party Coordination",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Welcome.Content": "Party spell coordination helps your group work together to prepare the most effective spell loadout. This feature shows which spells each party member has prepared, identifies redundant spell preparation, highlights coverage gaps in your party, and suggests spell synergies and combos.\nThis tour will show you how to use party coordination to optimize your group's magical capabilities!",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Button.Title": "Opening Party Mode",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Button.Content": "This button opens the Party Coordinator (only visible when your character is in a party or group). Left Click opens the full party coordination interface. Right Click opens a quick menu to toggle party mode display.\nWhen party mode is active, you'll see small character tokens next to spells that other party members have prepared.",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Coordinator.Title": "Party Coordinator Interface",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Coordinator.Content": "The Party Coordinator shows an overview of all spellcasters in your group. You can see each party member's prepared spells, total spell coverage by level and school, redundancy warnings for duplicate preparations, and gap analysis showing missing spell types.\nThe interface updates in real-time as party members prepare or change spells.",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Coverage.Title": "Spell Coverage Overview",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Coverage.Content": "This section visualizes your party's spell coverage. Schools of Magic shows which schools are well-represented. Spell Levels helps identify levels where coverage is weak. Spell Categories tracks damage, healing, control, utility, and more. Coverage Score provides an overall rating of party spell diversity.\nGreen indicates good coverage, yellow shows moderate, and red highlights gaps that might leave your party vulnerable.",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Redundancy.Title": "Redundancy Detection",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Redundancy.Content": "SpellBook automatically detects when multiple party members prepare the same spell. High Redundancy indicates 3 or more party members with the same spell, which might be excessive. Moderate Redundancy shows 2 party members with the same spell, which is sometimes useful for backup. Suggestions provide alternative spells that could replace redundant preparations.\nSome redundancy is good (multiple healers preparing Cure Wounds), but too much reduces your party's versatility.",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Gaps.Title": "Coverage Gap Analysis",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Gaps.Content": "This panel highlights important spell categories your party is missing. Critical Gaps shows essential spells no one has prepared (healing, detection, dispelling). Tactical Gaps shows useful spells that would expand options (control, buffing, summoning). Suggested Spells provides specific recommendations to fill gaps.\nClick on a suggested spell to see which party members can prepare it.",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Icons.Title": "Party Icon Display",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Icons.Content": "When party mode is active in your SpellBook, small character tokens appear next to spells. These icons show which party members also have this spell prepared. Tokens are color-coded by player color for easy identification. Hover over a token to see the character's name. The display is limited to a configurable number of icons to avoid clutter.\nThis gives you instant visibility into spell overlap while you're preparing your own spells!",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Focus.Title": "Spellcasting Focus System",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Focus.Content": "The Focus system helps parties coordinate magical roles. Each player declares their spellcasting focus (damage, healing, control, etc.). SpellBook suggests spells matching your chosen focus. Party view shows the distribution of focuses. This helps avoid situations like too many healers or no crowd control.\nYou can change your focus at any time. The GM can customize available focus options in module settings.",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Synergy.Title": "Spell Synergy Recommendations",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Synergy.Content": "SpellBook identifies powerful spell combinations across your party. Combo Setups shows spells that work well together (Web plus Fireball, Faerie Fire plus Attack Rolls). Buff Stacking identifies compatible buff spells that can be layered. Debuff Chains shows debuffs that synergize for increased effectiveness. Tactical Pairs highlights spells that enable powerful strategies.\nWhen you see a synergy recommendation, coordinate with your party to ensure both spells are prepared!",

    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Tips.Title": "Party Coordination Tips",
    "SPELLBOOK.Tours.PartySpells.Tips.Content": "Make the most of party coordination. Communicate by sharing this interface with your party during prep sessions. Diversify and aim for variety unless you have a specific strategy. Plan ahead by considering upcoming challenges when preparing. Be flexible and don't over-optimize; spontaneous play is fun too. Essential coverage means always ensuring someone can heal and dispel magic. Ritual spells should be prepared by Wizards so others don't have to.\nParty coordination is a tool, not a requirement. Use it as much or as little as your group prefers!"
